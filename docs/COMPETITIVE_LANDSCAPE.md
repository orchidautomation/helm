## Market Gaps & Opportunities

### Gap 1: Voice-First Productivity
**Insight:** Mobile devices are ubiquitous, but typing on mobile sucks. Voice is 3x faster than typing on mobile, yet no productivity tool is voice-native.

**Opportunity:** Capture users who think on the go (founders, operators, busy parents).

---

### Gap 2: Autonomous Execution
**Insight:** Every tool today requires manual execution. Notion/Linear/Asana are glorified to-do lists. Users still have to do the work.

**Opportunity:** Be the first productivity tool that actually does work for you.

---

### Gap 3: Learning System
**Insight:** Tools today are static. They don't learn your patterns or suggest improvements.

**Opportunity:** Build a system that gets smarter over time, creating network effects.

---

### Gap 4: Cross-System Intelligence
**Insight:** Productivity tools operate in silos. Notion doesn't talk to your CRM. Linear doesn't update your calendar.

**Opportunity:** Orchestration layer across all productivity tools.

---

## Differentiation Strategy

### Primary Differentiators
1. **Voice-first task capture** (10x faster than typing)
2. **Autonomous sub-agents** (tasks execute themselves)
3. **Progressive learning** (system suggests new workflows)
4. **MCP-native** (standardized integrations, not custom APIs)

### Moats (Long-Term Defensibility)
1. **Data moat:** User workflow patterns (hard to replicate)
2. **Network effects:** Agent marketplace (more agents = more value)
3. **Switching costs:** Once agents know you, hard to leave
4. **Platform moat:** Own orchestration layer across tools
