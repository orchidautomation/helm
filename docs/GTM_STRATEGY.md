## Onboarding & Activation

### Step 1: Sign Up (< 30 seconds)
- Email + password OR Google OAuth
- No credit card required for free tier

### Step 2: Onboarding Tutorial (2 minutes)
- Welcome video (30s): "Here's how it works"
- Sample voice dump: "Try saying: I have a meeting with Sarah tomorrow..."
- AI extracts 3 demo tasks → Show in Kanban
- Prompt: "Now try your own voice dump"

### Step 3: First Real Task (Aha Moment)
- User records their own voice dump
- AI extracts tasks
- Show categorization + Kanban
- **Aha:** "Wow, that was so much faster than typing!"

### Step 4: Agent Introduction
- Notification: "Want me to prep for that meeting with Sarah?"
- User clicks "Yes" → Meeting Prep Agent runs
- Result shown in 2 minutes
- **Aha:** "Wait, it actually did the work for me?"

### Step 5: Connect Tools (Optional)
- Prompt: "Connect your Calendar, CRM, Drive for full power"
- OAuth flows for each tool
- Skip option (can connect later)

**Activation criteria:** User completes voice dump + sees 1 agent execution
**Target activation rate:** 60% of signups

---

## Retention Strategy

### Week 1: Habit Formation
- Daily email: "Did you know you can..." (feature tips)
- Push notification: "You have 3 pending tasks" (gentle nudge)
- In-app prompts: "Try the Research Agent for this task"

### Week 2-4: Value Reinforcement
- Weekly summary email: "You saved X hours this week"
- Agent performance report: "Meeting Prep Agent completed 5 tasks"
- Prompt to connect more tools (if not done yet)

### Month 2+: Community & Expansion
- Invite to Slack community (peer support, feature requests)
- Prompt to explore agent marketplace
- Referral incentive: "Invite 3 friends, get 1 month free"

**Churn triggers to monitor:**
- No voice dump in 7 days → Email: "Miss us? Here's what's new"
- Agent failure rate > 20% → Personal outreach: "Let's debug together"
- Downgrade from paid to free → Exit survey: "What can we improve?"

**Target retention:**
- Month 1: 70%
- Month 3: 60%
- Month 6: 50%
- Month 12: 40%

---

## Growth Loops

### Loop 1: Voice → Agents → Time Saved → Referrals
```
User voice-dumps tasks
→ Agents execute autonomously
→ User saves 10 hours/week
→ User tells 3 founder friends ("You HAVE to try this")
→ Friends sign up
→ Repeat
```

**Virality coefficient (k):** 0.3 (each user refers 0.3 users on average)
**Cycle time:** 2 weeks (time from signup to referral)

---

### Loop 2: Agent Marketplace → Network Effects
```
User creates custom agent for their workflow
→ Publishes to marketplace
→ Other users install it
→ Creator earns revenue (70% split)
→ Creator promotes on Twitter ("I made $500/month from my agent!")
→ Attracts more users + creators
→ Repeat
```

**Target:** 500 agents in marketplace by Year 2, 50 active creators

---

### Loop 3: Content → SEO → Organic Growth
```
User shares success story on Twitter
→ We turn it into case study blog post
→ Post ranks for "AI productivity tool for founders"
→ Organic traffic → signups
→ More success stories
→ Repeat
```

**Target:** 50% of signups from organic (search + social) by Year 2

---

---

## Success Criteria (6-Month Checkpoints)

**After Month 3 (Beta):**
- ✅ 100 beta users
- ✅ 70%+ weekly retention
- ✅ NPS > 40
- ✅ Agent success rate > 85%

**After Month 6 (Launch):**
- ✅ 2,000 total users
- ✅ 300 paid users ($6K MRR)
- ✅ 50% activation rate
- ✅ 60% monthly retention
- ✅ $100 CAC, $300 LTV (3:1 ratio)

**If not met:**
- Pivot on pricing (lower to $10?)
- Focus on single persona (founders only?)
- Improve core value prop (more agents, better UX)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Users don't trust AI autonomy
**Mitigation:**
- Start with human-in-loop (approve before send)
- Gradual rollout (read-only → suggestions → auto-execute)
- Transparency (show all agent actions, audit logs)

### Risk 2: Competitors copy features
**Mitigation:**
- Speed to market (ship before Linear/Notion react)
- Build moats (data, marketplace, platform effects)
- Focus on unique value (voice-first, sub-agents, learning)

### Risk 3: CAC too high to scale profitably
**Mitigation:**
- Optimize onboarding for organic (virality coefficient > 0.5)
- Build content moat (SEO, thought leadership)
- Focus on retention (LTV > 3x CAC)
