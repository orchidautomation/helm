## Slide 2: The Problem

**Title:** "Busy Founders Are Drowning in Cognitive Overhead"

**Visual:** Split-screen comparison

```
Left side (Current Reality):                Right side (Impact):
┌──────────────────────────────┐           ┌──────────────────┐
│ 📋 50+ tasks in their head   │           │ 20 hrs/week lost │
│ 💭 Context scattered across  │           │ Constant burnout │
│    10+ tools                 │           │ Missed deadlines │
│ ⌨️  Manual task entry        │           │ Cognitive fatigue│
│ 🔄 Constant context-switching│           │ Can't scale      │
└──────────────────────────────┘           └──────────────────┘
```

**Talking points:**
- "Founders wear 10 hats: sales, product, ops, hiring, fundraising..."
- "They don't need another to-do list. They need an autonomous team."
- "Current tools (Linear, Notion, Asana) are glorified spreadsheets—they track work but don't do it."

**Data point:**
- "The average knowledge worker switches tools 1,200 times/day" (Source: RescueTime)
- "Founders waste 40% of their time on coordination, not execution" (Hypothesis to validate)

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

**Title:** "Voice → AI → Done. Your Autonomous Nervous System"

**Visual:** User journey diagram

```
┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  Voice   │ --> │   AI     │ --> │  Agents  │ --> │   Done   │
│  Dump    │     │ Extract  │     │ Execute  │     │          │
│          │     │  Tasks   │     │          │     │          │
│ 5 minutes│     │ Organize │     │ Calendar │     │ 10 hours │
│ speaking │     │ Category │     │ CRM      │     │  saved   │
│          │     │          │     │ Drive    │     │          │
└──────────┘     └──────────┘     └──────────┘     └──────────┘
```

**Key Features (3 bullets):**
1. **Voice-first task capture** - 10x faster than typing
2. **Specialized sub-agents** - Meeting prep, proposals, research (autonomous execution)
3. **Cross-system orchestration** - Calendar + CRM + Drive + Slack (one brain, all tools)

**Talking points:**
- "Speak your to-dos once. AI extracts, organizes, and executes autonomously."
- "It's like hiring 5 assistants who know exactly how you work—for $50/month instead of $5,000."

## Slide 9: Competitive Landscape

**Title:** "We're Category-Creating, Not Competing"

**Visual:** 2x2 Matrix

```
                     AI-Native
                         ▲
                         │
            Cursor •     │     • Us
                         │
        Notion AI •      │
                         │
          Zapier •       │          • Motion

                         │
                     Legacy
```

**Differentiation:**
- ✅ Voice-first (no one else)
- ✅ Sub-agents (Cursor has dev agents, we have life/work agents)
- ✅ Progressive learning (tools today are static)
- ✅ MCP-native (standardized vs. custom integrations)

**Positioning:** "Linear tracks work. We DO the work."

**Moats (long-term):**
1. **Data moat** - User workflow patterns (hard to replicate)
2. **Network effects** - Agent marketplace
3. **Switching costs** - Once agents know you, hard to leave
4. **Platform moat** - Orchestration layer across all tools

- Total: ~$4,200/month

Revenue: $200K/month ($20 ARPU × 10K users)
Gross Margin: 98%
```

**Talking points:**
- "We're using the same stack as Cursor, v0, and Replit"
- "This stack enables us to ship 50% faster than competitors using traditional tech"
- "Infrastructure costs scale sub-linearly (98% gross margin at 10K users)"
- "Every layer is AI-native, not bolted-on AI features"

**Technical risks addressed:**
- Multi-model support via AI Gateway (not locked into one provider)
- Convex handles real-time sync (proven at scale)
- Inngest manages agent orchestration (battle-tested)
- Full observability (Vercel Analytics, Inngest Dashboard, Sentry)

## Pitch Delivery Tips

### Do's:
- ✅ Tell a story (problem → solution → vision)
- ✅ Show, don't tell (demo > slides)
- ✅ Be concise (10-15 min max, save time for Q&A)
- ✅ Show conviction ("This will be a $100M company in 5 years")
- ✅ Know your numbers cold (unit economics, CAC, LTV)

### Don'ts:
- ❌ Read slides word-for-word
- ❌ Cram too much text (use visuals)
- ❌ Overpromise traction (be honest)
- ❌ Ignore questions (if you don't know, say so)
- ❌ Go over time (respect investor schedule)

## Likely Investor Questions

**Q: "Why won't Linear/Notion just add this?"**
A: "They could, but they're optimized for static tools, not autonomous execution. We're AI-native from day 1. Plus, we have a 12-18 month head start."

**Q: "What if users don't trust AI to execute on their behalf?"**
A: "We start with human-in-loop (approve before send), then gradually automate as trust builds. Early data shows 85% approval rate."

**Q: "How do you prevent agents from messing up (e.g., sending wrong email)?"**
A: "QA agents review outputs, audit logs track all actions, user can undo. Plus, we start with low-risk tasks (research, drafts) before high-risk (send email)."

**Q: "What's your unfair advantage?"**
A: "Timing (MCP just launched), founder expertise (we've built AI systems before), and speed (we'll ship faster than Big Tech)."

**Q: "How do you scale beyond founders?"**
A: "Founders first (willing to pay premium), then agency owners (recurring workflows), then ICs (mass market). Each segment expands TAM."

**Q: "What's your moat?"**
A: "Data (user workflows), network effects (agent marketplace), switching costs (agents learn you over time), platform (orchestration layer)."
